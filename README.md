# Predicting Noisy Images using KNN Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to predict the corresponding non-noisy images from their noisy counterparts using a KNN Classifier. The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the classifier.

## Steps
1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary Python libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.
2. **Define the Function to Show Images**: Define a function to visualize images from the dataset.
3. **Load the Data**: Load the MNIST dataset.
4. **Explore the Data**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
5. **Shuffle the Data**: Shuffle the training data to randomize the order of samples.
6. **Add Noise to the Data**: Add noise to the images in the dataset to simulate noisy conditions.
7. **View the Noisy Data**: Visualize the noisy images to inspect the effect of added noise.
8. **Train a KNN Classifier**: Train a KNN classifier on the noisy images.
9. **Predict Noisy Images**: Use the trained classifier to predict non-noisy images from the noisy ones.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have installed all the necessary dependencies.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the code and analyze the results.
